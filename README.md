==================

RoboViz is a monitor and vizualization tool for the [RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation League](http://wiki.robocup.org/wiki/Soccer_Simulation_League). This is a fork of the original version by Justin Stoecker [hosted on SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rcroboviz/). It has a number of improvements, bugfixes and new features listed in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

Except for the available shortcuts, the information on the [original website](https://sites.google.com/site/umroboviz) is still largely accurate. A complete list of shortcuts is available via a help window opened with the `F1` hotkey. Alternatively, it's also available as a `.html` file in `resources/help/controls.html`.
